<b>My CV website</b>

A website for potential employers to look at to check out my CV. The website is reactive and so fits well on most devices, it is also printable using a button at the bottom of the page. The print function can be used to print to PDF if a PDF is needed.

This project makes use of ReactJs to write the website in a component way and be able to easily compile and build the application since the source code will need constant updates as my career develops. It was also the first look at using CSS away from just screens and also focusing on how media queries can be used for other things but especially the @print media query.
